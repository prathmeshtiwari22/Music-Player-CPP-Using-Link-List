# Song Playlist Manager (C++)

## Introduction

The Song Playlist Manager is a C++ application that allows users to manage a list of songs. It provides features for adding, deleting, displaying, searching, and playing songs in a playlist. The application also keeps track of recently played songs and offers options for sorting the playlist.

## Features

- **Add New Song:** Users can add new songs to the playlist. The songs are stored in a text file named "playlist.txt" for future reference.

- **Delete Song:** Songs can be deleted from the playlist, either by searching for a specific song or by specifying the position in the list.

- **Display Playlist:** Users can view the entire playlist, including all the songs in the current order.

- **Total Songs:** The application can count and display the total number of songs in the playlist.

- **Search Song:** Users can search for a specific song in the playlist.

- **Play Song:** Play a song from the playlist. The application also maintains a list of recently played songs.

- **Recently Played List:** Users can see the list of songs played most recently.

- **Last Played Song:** The application shows the last song played.

- **Sorted Playlist:** The playlist can be sorted alphabetically based on the song names.

- **Add From File:** Users can load songs from an external file and add them to the playlist.
